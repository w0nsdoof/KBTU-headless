Using the extracted data in ./out/ (faculties.jsonl, departments.jsonl, programs.jsonl, topics.jsonl, pages.jsonl, edges.jsonl, \_report.json),
summarize the KBTU site structure as if designing Django apps and their relationships.

Deliver:

1. Suggested Django apps (e.g., faculties, departments, programs, content, topics).
2. Core models per app with their main fields based on extracted data.
3. Relationships between apps (ForeignKey, ManyToMany).
4. Which models should support translations and how (JSON fields or separate tables).
5. Any shared resources (media, tags, reusable components).
6. Include a short diagram-style interaction map (apps and arrows).

Output the summary in clear Markdown sections: **Apps Overview**, **Models and Fields**, **Relationships**, **Internationalization Strategy**, and **Shared Resource Notes**.
